# Encrypted Bookmarks Exporter Add-on for Firefox browser.

<br/>
This is my final project at Software Security/Cybersecurity course as part of academic studies.
<br/>
This add-on for Firefox browser allows user to export bookmarks into encrypted file to store it locally, as well as decrypt the file and import bookmarks into browser using this add-on.
<br/>

## Debugging in Firefox 
Enter this adreess into Firefox's Searchbar:
```firefox search bar
about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
```
Here opens debugging page and we can `Load Temporary Add-on`.<br/>
Next, open add-on's console by clicking `Inspect` to inspect log.
